This submission, titled Perdition, is a prototype of a dialogue-focused game inspired by Christian beliefs about the afterlife and the nature of sin. In the game, the player is taken on several excursions to visit souls in the Christian afterlife, who have been sent to either Hell, Purgatory or Heaven, after which the player converses with an angel about the reasoning behind each judgement.

In the "tour" segment for each soul, background is provided about their life on Earth and the deeds that are relevant to their judgement. When talking to the angel, the player is given the chance to object to each soul's judgement with several arguments.

The game is intended to cover several topics, including:
- The biblical morals that seem alien to many people today.
- Christian beliefs about evangelism and conversion, and their logical conclusion.
- The concept of Hell.

### Characters

Two characters were written for the prototype.

The first judged soul is Cuauhtemoc, a man who lived in the pre-Columbian Aztec empire (and thus never encountered Christianity) and was sacrificed to the god Huitzilopochtli at the age of 70.
His worship of a foreign god constitutes heresy, so he was sent to Hell. The player can argue that because he never encountered Christianity, it is unjust to judge him by Christian law and expect him to worship the Christian god.

The second soul, who reached Heaven, is Dominic Lindsay Ellis, Jr.. In-game, he is described in vague terms, but is intended to be a fundamentalist Christian American politician, who, several hundred years in the future, oversees the genocide of an unspecified cultural or religious group. The angel draws a comparison between him and Samson, a biblical hero who appears to kill thousands of innocent people in the city of Gaza in accordance with God's will.

Some characters were not added:
Luca Nicola Scipione, a devout man with a generally easy life, who had debilitating medical problems in his old age and chose euthanasia. Sent to Hell for suicide. Intended to mirror the story of Job.

### Player experience

The judgement each soul has received is intended to be seen as unjust. If the player objects, the angel justifies each judgement with Bible passages, theological arguments, and quotes from modern-day Christians.
The intended experience for the player is a detached fascination at the "blue-and-orange morality" of this world and the exotic punishments of the people in the afterlife, later followed by surprise or shock that this interpretation of the afterlife appears to be supported by the Bible. The game draws attention to the uncomfortable morality of the Bible and forces the player to consider that even today, this is how many people see the world.

### Iteration & design

The character concepts were finished before the rest of the game was designed or made.

The concept went through several design iterations. At first, the game was going to be a walking simulator where the player explores several different surreal environments in the afterlife. Information on each character was provided, but there was no "angel segment". The angel was added later in the design process as a way to provide real theological context.
