### Overview and themes

  

This submission, titled Perdition, is a prototype of a dialogue-focused game inspired by Christian beliefs about the afterlife and the nature of sin. In the game, the player is taken on several excursions to visit souls in the Christian afterlife, who have been sent to either Hell, Purgatory or Heaven, after which the player converses with an angel about the reasoning behind each judgement.

  

In the "tour" segment for each soul, background is provided about their life on Earth and the deeds that are relevant to their judgement. When talking to the angel, the player is given the chance to object to each soul's judgement with several arguments.

  

The game is intended to cover several topics, including:

- The strange biblical morals that seem alien to many people today.

- Christian beliefs about evangelism and conversion, and their logical conclusion.

- The concept of Hell.

  

### Characters

  
  
  

### Player experience

  

The judgement each soul has received is intended to be seen as unjust. If the player objects, the angel justifies each judgement with Bible passages, theological arguments, and quotes from modern-day Christians.

The intended experience for the player is a detached fascination at the "blue-and-orange morality" of this world and the exotic punishments of the people in the afterlife, later followed by surprise or shock that this interpretation of the afterlife appears to be supported by the Bible. The game draws attention to the uncomfortable morality of the Bible and forces the player to consider that even today, this is how many people see the world.

  

### Iteration & design

  

The character concepts were finished before the rest of the game was designed or made. Two characters were written for the prototype:

  

The first judged soul is Cuauhtemoc, a man who lived in the pre-Columbian Aztec empire (and thus never encountered Christianity) and was sacrificed to the god Huitzilopochtli at the age of 70.

His worship of a foreign god constitutes heresy, so he was sent to Hell. The player can argue that because he never encountered Christianity, it is unjust to judge him by Christian law and expect him to worship the Christian god.

  

The second soul, who reached Heaven, is Dominic Lindsay Ellis, Jr.. In-game, he is described in vague terms, but is intended to be a fundamentalist Christian American politician, who, several hundred years in the future, oversees the genocide of an unspecified cultural or religious group. The angel draws a comparison between him and Samson, a biblical hero who appears to kill thousands of innocent people in the city of Gaza in accordance with God's will.

  

Some characters were written but not added, including:

Luca Nicola Scipione, a devout man with a generally easy life, who had debilitating medical problems in his old age and chose euthanasia. Sent to Hell for suicide. Intended to mirror the story of Job.

  

The concept went through several design iterations. At first, the game was going to be a walking simulator where the player explores several different surreal environments in the afterlife. Information on each character was provided, but there was no "angel segment". The angel was added later in the design process as a way to provide real theological context.

  

I eventually decided against making the game a walking simulator, because it was taking too much time to build and test each environment. The game was always supposed to have a variety of different environment types for the different parts of Heaven and Hell, but it would have taken too long to develop each environment in a polished and player-friendly way. The half-finished scenes were adapted into a series of prerendered screenshots that the player can click through, similar to games like Myst. In a full version of this game the tour segments could be made nonlinear to give the player more freedom when navigating.

  

  
  
  
  
  

### Critical reflection

  

I was most pleased with how the angel scene turned out. In the end I didn’t write a lot of dialogue for the game, and most of what I’ve written is shown in the video demo. I believe the back-and-forth conversation with the angel is a good proof of concept, and a good medium for the game’s “serious” content.

  

I think the surreal visuals provide a good hook for the game’s narrative and complement the first part of the intended player experience described earlier, of being fascinated at this strange world before being brought back to reality.

  

The angel segments could be distributed differently for a different effect. This player experience would be better served by having all of the tour segments happen in a row, then have the angel dialogue as one long chapter at the end of the game. The video demonstrates the prototype by going through each tour segment, then playing the angel dialogue for that segment. This approach spaces out the content more evenly, but only allows a single tour segment before the real point of the game becomes clear.

  

Providing real-world context (Bible passages and other quotes) is important for the intended effect to be realized, but in the prototype this additional context is limited to what the angel directly quotes in its dialogue. However, there are usually dozens of Bible quotes and many pieces of commentary that can be used to address any given subject. A more sophisticated dialogue system could, rather than block-quoting the Bible, provide hypertext citations around the angel’s dialogue window that link to an in-game copy of the Bible. I decided against adding this to the prototype because it would be particularly time-consuming to create a whole interface for the browser and format the Bible as required, but it would definitely increase the intended effect in a finished product.

  

The thing I’m most unsatisfied with is the lack of game-like elements. Although the visuals would be missing, the story would work just as well in writing. If it’s to be made as a videogame, it should take more advantage of the medium to create the intended effect. A more developed prototype could have included more game-like elements, such as testing the player on their knowledge of the Bible and what constitutes a sin. Rather than the angel dictating the reasoning for each judgement to the player, the player themselves could make the judgements by studying a set of provided Bible passages for each case.
