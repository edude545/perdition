CUAUHTEMOC WILL NOW BE JUDGED
ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF GOD

"Ratify"
	THE SENTENCE
	IS JUST
	...
	WHAT
	WAS HIS SIN
		""
"Object"
	WHAT
	IS YOUR OBJECTION
	"He could not possibly have heard the word of God."
		WHAT HAPPENS TO A MAN WHO HAS NEVER HEARD THE GOSPEL?
		SOME BELIEVE THAT GOD IN HIS INFINITE LOVE LETS THEM INTO HEAVEN.
		THIS BELIEF IS NOT ALIGNED WITH SCRIPTURE.
		ROMANS 1:18-20
		"The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse."
		AND IN THE WORDS OF AN EARTHLY PASTOR:
		"When people ask what happens to the innocent guy in Africa who dies without ever hearing the gospel, I would say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, he goes to heaven. However, before you begin to label me a heretic, consider: if there is an innocent guy in Africa who has never heard the gospel, then he doesn’t need a Savior. He hasn’t done anything wrong, so why would he be separated from God?"
		"But that’s precisely the problem: there is no innocent guy in Africa or Asia."
		THE LORD'S PRESENCE IS CLEAR TO EVERY PERSON ON EARTH, BUT THIS TRUTH IS SUPPRESSED BY THE WICKEDNESS OF SINNERS.
		THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF GOD, AND THOSE WHO HAVE SINNED - THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME.
		CUAUHTEMOC BELONGS IN HELL.
