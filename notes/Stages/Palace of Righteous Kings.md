### PALACE OF RIGHTEOUS KINGS, MARS

Dominic Lindsay Ellis Jr. was born on Earth in the six thousand fifty sixth year of Creation.
He was a great governor who kept God close to his heart and brought prosperity to God's people.
He witnessed Heaven's light through his father and resolved to spend the rest of his life spreading the holy Word.
Under his rulership the worship of a foreign god was eliminated, and a nation of sinners and idolaters was redeemed in the eyes of the Lord.
