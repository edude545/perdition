Luca Nicola Scipione was born on Earth in the 6,201st year of Creation.
He lived righteously, and kept Christ in his heart; God sent him infirmity and disease to test his faith. He could not bear to live any longer, and had himself killed.
He died on the 6,265th year of Creation, and was condemned to perdition, where he will learn to appreciate the gift of life.
