### SOLAR DUNGEON, CITY OF DIS, SIXTH CIRCLE

The Solar Dungeon is located in Heresy, underneath the city of Dis. It specifically houses idolaters who worshipped the sun in life.
The dungeon is constructed like an amphitheater or panopticon prison of cosmic proportions. At the exact centre of the dungeon is a sun: an exact replica of the sun visible from Earth. It exists in the dungeon to teach that the LORD is infinitely greater than any pagan god that is visible with the eyes.

Cuauhtemoc was born in the four thousand, six hundred and sixtieth year of Creation. His ancestors rejected the LORD their Father, and worshipped a false god.
In his seventieth year he offered himself as sacrifice to his god.
For his worship of a false idol, and for rejecting the gift of Life, he was condemned to damnation, where he and his brethren stare into the face of their god until the end of time.
