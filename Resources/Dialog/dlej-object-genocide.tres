As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands. Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.", "Then Samson said,

With a donkey’s jawbone
    I have killed a thousand men.\"", "YET SAMSON'S STRENGTH WAS NOT HUMAN. HE COULD NOT HAVE PERFORMED HIS DEEDS WITHOUT THE STRENGTH OF GOD BEHIND HIM.
DOMINIC LINDSAY ELLIS WIELDED A SIMILAR LEVEL OF STRENGTH AS A GOVERNOR.", "NO MAN CAN ACHIEVE THIS LEVEL OF POWER WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY OF GOD.
